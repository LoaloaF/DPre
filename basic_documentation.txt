which

`euclid`     Requires the targets and samples to be loaded with expression data, (and recommended: target markergene lists). Assess change and state 
	     of transcriptional similarty by calculating the log2-z euclidean distance between targets and samples. Can also be used for C/T classification.

`intersect`  Requires the targets and samples to be laoded with markergene lists (targets) and differential gene lists (samples). 
	     Assess change in transcriptional similarity by rating the intersection between target markergenes and sample differential genes.


differential

True:   Requires a control in the samples for `euclid` metric. This will visualize the changes in transcriptional similarity. Instead of juding 
	whether a trancriptional change classifies as another C/T, this setting gives insight on the differential C/T bias.

False: 	Only available for the `euclid` metric. This will yield the absolute mean log2-z euclidean distance towards a target expression profile. 
	This setting allows for C/T classification.


proportional

True:   Requires differential to be True. Get the differential values as a proportion of the maximum possible effect. For the `euclid` metric, the 
	absolute mean euclidean distance of the control. For the 'intersect' metric, the number of C/T markergenes. 
	This setting shows the change in transcriptional similarity in relation to the base (control) state.


UNDETECTED_MARKERGENE_BAHAVIOUR
not relevent for intersect differential

Substitute not detected marker genes: Here, not detected genes are substituted with a z score equivalent to a read count of 0.
				      This provides the most correct description of the C/Ts transcriptional identity. Not detected marker genes
				      reduce C/T similarity heavily, thus this setting is biased to classify C/Ts similar to the base state.
				      The proportion of changed similarity refers to the entire marker gene list. 
				      Here, the proportional change in similarity can be interpretated as, "Sample X became 35% more similar to target Y".
				      
ignore not detected marker genes: Here, not detected genes are droped from the analysis. Only marker genes detected in the samples define transcriptional identity.
				  The proportion by which differnt C/T markergene lists are detected differ. Even if the markergene detection rate is 
				  low, based on the detected markergenes, similarity may still be rated as high. To avoid false positives from this, 
				  adjust DROP_TARGET_DETEC_THR. This setting is biased to suggest a change of the most similar transcriptional profiles.
				  The proportion of changed similarity refers only to the detected marker genes and may therefore be higher. 

DROP_TARGET_DETEC_THR 
		
	default: .15		Sets a minimal detection threshhold for the proportion of detected target markergenes. This avoids low accuacry similarity ratings due to 
				a small number of detected genes. Affects both UNDETECTED_MARKERGENE_BAHVIOUR settings. If not desired, set to 0.
