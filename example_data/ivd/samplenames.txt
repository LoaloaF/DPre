The sample names are:
ivd CM = in vitro differnetiated cardiomyocytes
ivd ESC = ESCs 
ivd MES = mesoderm cells (partially differnetiated, will be interesting to see if these are intermediate between ESC and CM?

ivd exendo = in vitro differentiated extra embryonic endoderm (i.e. the yolk sac). (Ignore the prdm14KD sample)

ivd mneu ESCD0 = ESCs
ivd mneu MND4 = in vitro differentiated motor neurons

ivd ra ctrl = ESCS
ivd ra D4 = retinoic acid differeitated ESCs (thought to be neuron-biased, but a mix of differentiated cells.
